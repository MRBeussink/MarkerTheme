# MarkerTheme

A simple, light and *colorful* theme for Xcode.

### About
Most Xcode themes suffer for one or both of two problems:
* they are boring, flat, or otherwise dull
* they do not match the light UI

MarkerTheme fixes these problems by being light and colorful, trying to match to the UI while also allowing `code` to pop off the screen without too much [eyestrain](https://justgetflux.com).

### Design

Jack White believes that [restrictions are an important part of creation](https://youtu.be/8iNCQPoYk70).  Taking his example, the theme follows a set of rules to add clarity to syntax.

#### Colors

Blue | #378CD5 | `types`, `classes`, `properties` and `variables` from `Swift` and other libraries
Purple | #822586 | project `variables`, `types`, and `classes`
Orange | #E76D30 | `functions` and `methods`
