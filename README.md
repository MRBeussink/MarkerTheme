# MarkerTheme
This is my *personal, handcrafted* theme for Xcode, tailored to my odd taste in things.

### About
While looking for a good theme for Xcode, I came across a few problems:

* The stock themes are boring and flat
* The UI cannot be changed
* Community themes do not match my own habits
* The ones that do are dark themes
  * Which don't match the UI
  * Or are dull and uninspired
  
So, finding a dose or two of inspiration, I set out to make a decent enough light theme.

### Inspiration & Design
Jack White believes that [limitation is an important part of creativity] (https://youtu.be/eH4NhlxSrOw).  I like to think of a set of restrictions as creative rules.  I took [burodepeper's](https://github.com/burodepeper) rules for his [Minimal Atom theme](https://atom.io/themes/minimal-syntax) and applied theme to my own habits.
* **Red**: is for `constants`, `numeric` and `character literals`
* **Green**: is for `string literals`, `attributes` and `preprocessor statements`
* **Blue**: is for `types`, `classes`, and `properties` from Swift or other libraries

While adding:
* **Purple**: is for project `variables`, `types`, and `classes`
* **Yellow**: is for `documentation` comments
* **Orange**: is for functions and methods

Emphasis is used to either make code pop or distinguish tokens of the same color.

Also, the palete was taken from the classic Apple six color logo.
